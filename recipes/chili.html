    <p>Homemade chili is delicious and goes great with cornbread or over corn chips for a chili pie! I like to use spicy pinto beans.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 can kidney beans</li>
        <li>1 can stewed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups water</li>
        <li>1 pinch chili powder</li> 
        <li>1 pinch garlic powder</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Place ground beef and onion in a large saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir until meat is browned and onion is tender, about 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in tomato sauce, kidney beans, and stewed tomatoes with juice. If you prefer a thinner consistency, you can add water. Season with chili powder, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover and let simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
